# Pthread 101

Some usage of pthread as examples.

For starters, **src** has all examples as code. You can compile them to execute each one.

### Installation

**make** is needed to use [Makefile](Makefile).

You can use any **C compiler** you want. 

Just use [Makefile](Makefile) to build each executable.
```sh
make
```
**P.S.:** Makefile is configured to use GCC as compiler. If you want to change it, just assign **CC** in Makefile to your compiler of choice.

### Usage

There will be an executable for each example after compilation. You can execute them as following.
```sh
./hello_thread
./array_remove
```
